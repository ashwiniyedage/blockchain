Day-1 Assignment
------------------------------------------------------------
1) What is your understanding of Blockchain?
-> Blockchain is a mixture of two technology:-
	a]Distributed Database
	b]Cryptography
  Where information is -
	-verifiable
	-unchangeble
	-tamper-proof
	-immutable
   Key Advantage of Blockchain is- We are able to track if anything is getting changed in the data.

2) What is core problem Blockchain trying to solve?
-> After the 2008 crisis, it came into existence. The feature which the internet fails to
   provide like security and authenticity is provided by a blockchain.

3) What are the few fetures which blockchain will give you?
-> 1)Verifiable
   2)Unchangeble
   3)Tamper-proof
   4)Immutable

4) What all things does a Block contain?
-> Bock contain follwing things:-
	1]Block number
	2]Previous block signature
	3]Transaction data
	4]Mining key

5] How is the verifiability of Blockchain has been attend?
-> It works on the system of the fingerprint. Each block has its own special unique 
   signature, which is stored in the next block too. If the copy of that block exists
   somewhere, its signature is compared, only if it matches, its c concluded that the 
   copy is exactly replicated. if the majority of copies have the same signature and 
   the copy has a different one, its v verified that it's been tampered with and 
   hence necessary action is taken. To summarize, so if someone does any data 
   modifications in one block, it will be changed into other blocks in the same network. 
   Verification takes place by checking with another blockchain on the channel network.
   Hence verifiability can be achieved by block chain.
